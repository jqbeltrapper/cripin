If I with you,  I fuck that shit with you
Can nobody fuck it but you
May be stay humble and hustle hard
I said ya fucked the system 
Me to it was not MA mistake
The later I prayed cricket 
Saba man greet Lydia 
Underman take out
Ain’t  gangster,  I just do gangster shits
I told you bad and toy want me work hard
Tell me the color of your eyes blue or black
I will just put ya down before ya join bloods
You’ll be broke if you don’t hustle hard
  You said bel trapper and jq believes 
If you pray for ,ma downfall
You should get a refund
MA circle got smaller 
Then MA visions got clear 
Trapper your memo ⭐ star
